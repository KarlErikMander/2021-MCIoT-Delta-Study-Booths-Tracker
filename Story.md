### Delta study room app story
#
William is master of international relation student in the University of Tartu. William is always complaining about finding empty study room in the Delta building like other students, therefore, we came up with solution. With this solution, when William will decide to go delta to study he can easily open mobile phone and look the custom map which room is empty, also he can check Delta study rooms from dorm, maybe from Antarctica if there is internet connection. Even he does not need to check every time the map if he is in the second floor of Delta, he can look far away the LED light which it will be located above the door of room and if it is green, this means room is empty or if light is red then it means the room is occupied by other students. Another thing is that our app will send notifications if there is any room is available on the second floor. Additionally, when William finds a study room and enters the room, app then shows that this room is occupied by William to other students. Also this app can be used by delta workers when rooms need to be clean or someone is inside. Finally, we added monitoring system to the app which William can check UI and analyze.
