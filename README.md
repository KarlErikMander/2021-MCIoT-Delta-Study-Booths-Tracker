<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Delta Study Booth Tracker is an app for anyone who uses delta study booths. You can see whether a booth is occupied from our simple to use app. The booths are tracked via a ultra-sonic sensor and also have a LED light to indicate visually, without the app, if the booth is full or not. 

The app has a scrollable list of the study booths, as well as a visual map.

The map and list. Green is empty, red is full. The men on the map as well as the list indicate whether a booth is full or not.
The booths are listed with the same letters as in real life. The map automatically opens with the Delta center as the main view.
